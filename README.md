# Python Data Structures and Algorithms
# Python数据结构与算法

No non-sense solutions to common Data Structure and Algorithm interview questions in Python. Follows a consistent approach throughout problems.

针对常见的 Python 数据结构和算法面试题，提供直截了当的解决方案。在所有问题的实现中遵循统一的方法。

## Objective
## 项目目标

There are a plenty of resources when it comes to interview preparations on the internet. What prompted me to create this project was the dissimilarity across different approaches and the infused complexity of the code.

互联网上面试准备的资源非常丰富。促使我创建这个项目的原因，是不同解决方案中实现方式的差异以及代码中不必要的复杂性。

Feel free to contribute but please follow the Contributing Guidelines as I want to maintain the uniformity of the implementation of data structures and algorithms. Last time around, people bombarded with me with Pull Requests, Issues and Emails insisting me to merge their changes

欢迎贡献代码，但请遵循贡献指南，因为我希望保持数据结构和算法实现风格的一致性。上一次，很多人向我提交拉取请求（Pull Requests）、问题（Issues）和邮件，坚持要求我合并他们的修改。

The open source community has helped me a lot during my interview preparations and studies while I was in my undergrad. I always wanted to give something back to the community. In my endeavour to contribute something back, I will be uploading data structures and algorithms questions in Python in this repo. Feel free to contribute and get in touch!

在我本科期间，开源社区在我的面试准备和学习中给了我巨大的帮助。我一直想为社区做些回报。为了践行回馈社区的承诺，我将在这个代码库中上传用 Python 实现的数据结构与算法问题。欢迎联系我并贡献力量！

## Structure of the repository

As of now, the repository contains 3 main directories: [**Bookmarks**](bookmarks), [**Data Structures**](data_structures) and [**Algorithms**](algorithms).

### Data Structures

Contains all data structure questions categorised into sub-directories like stack, queue, etc according to their type.

1. [Array](data_structures/array)
2. [Dictionary]()
3. [Binary Search Tree](data_structures/bst)
4. [Linked List](data_structures/linked_list)
5. [Stack](data_structures/stack)
6. [Graphs](data_structures/graphs)
7. [Circular Linked List](data_structures/circular_linked_list)
8. [Doubly Linked List](data_structures/doubly_linked_list)

### Algorithms

This directory contains various types of algorithm questions like Dynamic Programming, Sorting, Greedy, etc. The current structure of this directory is as follows:

1. [Dynamic Programming](algorithms/dynamic_programming)
2. [Graphs](algorithms/graph)
3. [Greedy](algorithms/greedy)
4. [Math](algorithms/math)
5. [Misc](algorithms/miscellaneous)
6. [Sorting](algorithms/sorting)
7. [Bit Manipulation](algorithms/bit_manipulation)

## Things need to be done

As you can see, the repo is still in its infancy. Here are some key things in the to-do.

1. Queue questions
2. Algorithms
3. More questions in data structures, especially for graph, circular linked list, trees, heaps and hash.
